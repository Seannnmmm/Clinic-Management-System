# Clinic-Management-System

In this project, I and my members developed a Clinic Management System (CMS) using Java, designed to streamline the operations of a clinic for administrators, doctors, and patients. The system includes functionalities such as user registration, appointment management, medical record management, and payment collection. Java's object-oriented features were utilized to create a modular, maintainable, and platform-independent solution. Data is stored in text files, ensuring persistence and accessibility. A supporting document details the implementation of object-oriented principles with code examples, highlighting the effective use of encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

All the source code is under the login zip file.
